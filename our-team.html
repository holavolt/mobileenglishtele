					&nbsp;"Working with children is the hardest and rewarding task I have ever done."<br><br>My name is Bea, I am 32 years old and I was born in Spain. I founded Telenanny in Madrid in 2011, and after working for a few years and also starting in Barcelona, I became a mom and moved to Mexico, leaving Telenanny aside. For 4 years I have been living with my son in this magical place and now I work as a teacher of plastic arts and theater in Péepem, a city for children that I recommend and that has allowed me to reopen Telenanny in Tulum with the love it deserves. Working with children is the hardest and rewarding task I have done. Being a mother has given me a new vision understanding the unconditional love that is required for this work.<br>
